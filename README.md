# Gaia-DR3-Milky-Way-TRGB

This repository contains the data and code used in "Gaia Data Release 3 View on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Luminosity" authored by Siyang Li, Stefano Casertano, and Adam Riess. We recommend running the scripts on a cluster as the 2D maximum likelihood algorithm can be computationally expensive.
